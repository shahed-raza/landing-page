* The landing page is made using HTML and CSS.

# Why does this exist?
* This project is for learning layout, primarily using flexbox and practice writing basic HTML, CSS

# What did i actually do?
* The page layout is handled & designed using flexboxes
* Divided the page into multiple sections
    * header
    * hero section
    * info section
    * quote section
    * call to action section
    * footer
* Each section is a container in html
* Each container is styled & handled using flex-box

# What i'm thankful of?
* Designig the basic structure of html beforehand in comments was very helpful

# What could i have done better?
* I should've also written the detailed steps or i'd say the algorithm, to style the page first, then style the page 

# What's missing?
* Explicit html tags assiting in accessibility features
* Most of the html is made up of div containers which don't much assist in providing accessibility
* Responsiveness for different screens sizes, zoom levels, mobile devices
* Content overflow in vertical dev tools bar
